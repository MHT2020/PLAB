# PLAB

Back in March 2019 when I started to work as Hiwi in chair of sensors and measurement in TU Chemnitz, the PLAB project began. One area of interest in our chair is wireless sensor networks in which low power consumption is a must. So, the aim was designing a ZigBee low power WSN node and power supply for the nodes.
